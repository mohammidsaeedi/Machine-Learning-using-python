# Support vector machines (SVMs)
are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.

The advantages of support vector machines are:
```
Effective in high dimensional spaces.

Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.

Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.

Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.

## We will use PCA and Cross-validation

## Dataset Description
```
The dataset includes 244 instances that regroup a data of two regions of Algeria,namely the Bejaia region located in the northeast of Algeria and the Sidi Bel-abbes region located in the northwest of Algeria.

122 instances for each region.

The period from June 2012 to September 2012.
The dataset includes 11 attribues and 1 output attribue (class)
The 244 instances have been classified into fire (138 classes) and not fireâ€ (106 classes) classes.
