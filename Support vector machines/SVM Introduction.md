# Support vector machines (SVMs)
are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.

The advantages of support vector machines are:
```
Effective in high dimensional spaces.

Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.

Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.

Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.

## We will use PCA and Cross-validation
