NLP

NLP stand for Natural language processing, it is study of input provided in natural language, it’s converts input into useful form of representations, ability of computer programs to understand natural language, and capable of processing and analyzing large amount of natural language data.
Objective of NLP to use AI and ML to let machine to understand human language.
Some Challenges in NLP:
-	Natural language understanding
-	Low resource scenarios
-	Dialects
-	Scare availability of data and computing resources to train language models.
-	Cross lingual management.

NLP first terms:
-	Corpus 
-	Information Extraction
-	Normalization
-	Named entity recognition
-	Stemming
-	Tokenization
NLP second terms:
-	Word sense disambiguation
-	Bag of words
-	N-gram
-	Regular expression
-	Explicit semantic analysis
-	Latent semantic analysis
-	Latent Dirichlet allocation

NLP steps:

-	Lexical analysis
-	Syntactic analysis
-	Semantic analysis

NLP Approaches:
-	Statistical
-	Symbolic
-	Connectionist
-	Hybrid


Parsing approaches is process of determining syntactic structures and analyzing constituent words based on underlying grammar.

Corpus or corpora:
-	Large and structured set of text typically presented in electronic form
-	Body of written or spoken material on which linguistic analysis is performed>
-	Provides evidence of how language is used in actual situations.

Type of corpus 
-	General corpus
-	Historical corpus
-	Learner corpus
-	Specialized corpus

Corpus Linguistic:
-	Principles and practice of using corpus 
-	Methodology consisting of large number of related methods
-	Draws on large amounts of authentic and naturally occurring language
-	Uses 

  1-	Computer for analysis
  
  2-	Quantitative and qualitative analytical techniques

Advantages of using corpus
-	Provides reliable and consistent analysis through the use of computers
-	Helps identify complex language patterns in use
-	Capable of storing and analyzing larger database of natural language 
-	Manages data using computers and provides linguistic analysis using linguists

NLP Libraries:

NLTK:

1-	Gensim

2-	Sckite-learn

3-	spaCy

4-	CoreNLP

5-	Polyglot

6-	PyNLPI

Advantages of NLTK:

- Platform for building python programs to work with human language data
- Helps with tasks such as Corpus – Categorizing text – analyzing linguistic structure 
- Provides easy to use interfaces for Corpus and Lexical resources

Tokenization one of the most important tasks in NLP and it is major role in the process of Lexical analysis

Main Components of   LP:
-	Entity extraction:

1-	Syntactic analysis

2-	Semantic analysis

3-	Sentiment analysis 

4-	Pragmatic analysis

Syntactic analysis is:

Proper ordering of words

Deals with structural roles of words in sentences.

Includes:

1-	Parts of speech tagging 

2-	Chunking

3-	Sentence assembling

Semantic analysis is:

Deals with lexical semantic

Extract entities and understand syntaxes

Concludes meanings of sentences in context free

Sentiment analysis is:

Understand the sentiment behind every sentence also known as opinion mining.

Include:

 Emotions – Opinions – Attitudes

Pragmatic analysis is:

Uses the context of utterance

Deals with intentions like

Criticize – Inform – Promise – Request

Main objective of Pragmatic analysis is interprets the meaning in terms of context of use , unloke semantics.
